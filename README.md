## The Earth Datasphere

The Earth Datasphere makes it easy to share data across a network of peers, everyone has the same view of the same data and integration costs for anyone joining the network are practically nil. Anyone can join and leave the network at will and decide how much data they share (via API interface) and what they do with the data they receive from peers.
